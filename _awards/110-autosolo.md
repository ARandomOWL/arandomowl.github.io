During 2014--2017 I competed in numerous AutoSolo competitions, collecting eight
trophies in that time. AutoSolo is an amateur motorsport which involves a timed
drive through a cone slalom. The event lasts a whole day and the 'test' layout
is normally changed two or four times, with each driver having three attempts at
each layout. Time penalties are given for hitting cones or driving the wrong
route.

To be competitive requires a smooth and consistent driving style, along with the
ability to remain focussed for the entire days' event. These events can be won
and lost at the touch of a cone.
