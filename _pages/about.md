I'm Adrian, a Research Fellow at the [Centre for Electronics
Frontiers](https://cef.soton.ac.uk/). I'm an engineer with specialisations in
low power digital circuits, asynchronous circuits and artificial intelligence. I
also love languages and consider myself an amateur linguist.

Find my publications on [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZbY1iJ4AAAAJ) and check out
some of my personal endevours on the [awards page](/awards/).
