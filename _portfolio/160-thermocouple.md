A 16x2 character LCD shows the thermocouple temperature spanning both lines for
readability. A hand-etched PCB is attached to the back which uses a PIC
microcontroller to read the thermocouple temperature and drive the LCD.

I drew traces by hand with etch-resistant pen, before etching in a bath of
ferric chloride. Wire wool cleans the remaining pen off the traces. The PCB
was then dipped into molten solder to 'tin' the traces and prevent tarnishing.
