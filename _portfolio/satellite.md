An energy harvester, battery charger and power controller for satellite
subsystems. I produced most of the layout, with some contributions from team
members. The PCB has four copper layer and components on both sides. I placed
all the components by hand with the help of a solder paste stencil, before
reflowing in a PCB oven.

Southampton Small Satellite project.
