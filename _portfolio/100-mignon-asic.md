Mignon is the first ASIC implementation of the [Tsetlin Machine](https://github.com/cair/TsetlinMachine).
Mignon implements a small classifier on 65nm technology.
I performed the entire tapeout from specification and RTL, to producing the
final GDS for manufacture.
Mignon is [due to appear](https://twitter.com/RishadShafik/status/1498964827754094593) at the [Norwegian Technical
Museum](https://www.tekniskmuseum.no/) in the near future.
